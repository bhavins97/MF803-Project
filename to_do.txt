##### THINGS TO DO! #######
#DONE(ish)# 1. Validation (testing), try to get as many different test cases as possible (where we know what the output should be). Price a basket on OVME on Bloomberg
#DONE# 2. Get an example going. Play around with changing n1 and n2, get a 3d graph of price with different n1 and n2. Plot price against strike
# 3. Look into premium of implied over realized vol and maybe add a premium to our calculation
# 4. Look at what happens when the basket is made up of assets that are highly correlated vs low/negative(?) correlation
#DONE# 5. Try using risk free rate as the expected return in the BS model


#LOWER PRIORITY STUFF
#6. Improve runtime - multiprocessing will be the easiest win. Cython and numba are other possibilities
#7. Exception handling
#8. Code documentation
